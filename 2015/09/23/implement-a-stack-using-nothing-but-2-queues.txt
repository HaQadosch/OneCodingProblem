Question

Implement a stack using nothing but 2 queues.

Remember that a stack has LIFO functionality and a queue is a FIFO.  A queue typically has the following methods:

    add(el) – Appends an element to the end of the queue.
    poll() – Removes the element at the front of the queue.
    empty()

A stack has:

    push(el) – Pushes an element on to the stack
    pop(el) – Pops the last element pushed from the stack.

So, use 2 of the first to implement the second. You do not need to maintain the typical runtime of these data structures.
